          <h6>About Me</h6>

          <img class="about-me-photo" src="images/about-me.jpg" alt="Cheryl Ju with Family" title="Cheryl Ju with Family" width="300px"/>
          <p><span>Hello everyone!</span> My name is Cheryl Ju (formally Sampson, as you will see on some of my portfolio examples.) I married the love of my life, Denny, in May 2018 lakeside at a beautiful resort. </p>

          <p>We quickly rescued our first puppy, Leo, shortly after our big day. Not even a year later, we completed our family of four with Luna, another dog adopted from the local rescue.</p>

          <p>Apart from my family, I started my Graphic Design and Hand-Crafted business in late 2017; however, I didn’t start selling my hand-crafts until the pandemic hit in 2020. Feel free to hop on over to <a class="link-in-main-text" href="http://www.dejudesigns.com" target="blank">my shop</a> to see all the different hand-crafted items I currently have for sale.</p>

        <!-- Main Content - Second Column -->
        <section class="two-columns-col-two">
          <p>I started my graphic design journey in the mid-2000s. During my weekends and off days, I began to teach myself HTML and CSS while learning how to design on Paint Shop Pro. When I graduated high school, I realized I wanted to continue my graphic design education. I graduated in 2014 from Cabrini College (now known as Cabrini University) with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Graphic Design. However, at the time, Cabrini mainly focused on print design, and the few web classes I had left me feeling not confident in my web skills.</p>

          <p>After many years of contemplating continuing education and learning more about web design, the pandemic helped me realize the need for remote online work. I decided to start my journey in getting my Master of Arts in Mass Communications with a specialization in Web Design from the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications in 2020.</p>
